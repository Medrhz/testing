//HTML Links - Hyperlinks//
<!--
HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

//HTML Links - Syntax//
<a href="url">link text</a>

//HTML Links - The target Attribute//

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

 //Link to an Email Address//
 Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):


 //Button as a Link//
To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.
JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:
